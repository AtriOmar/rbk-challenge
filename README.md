# RBK Front End Coding Challenge

## Overview

A Front End coding challenge organized by [RBK](https://www.rbktunisia.com), it consists of turning a given design into a functional website using any preferred technology.

## Challenge Details

- **Objective:** Transform the design into a social links sharing website.
- **Duration:** 24 hours
- **Participants:** Nearly 100
- **Completed:** Close to 30 participants successfully completed the challenge.

## Technology

I've chosen ReactJS because I am very familiar with and comfortable working with it, paired with Tailwind CSS as a styling framework to facilitate styling.

## Project Highlights

- **Responsive Design:** A great user experience across devices (The main focus was on the large screen version. Even though it's a responsive UI, the user experience is not 100% great on mobile devices).
- **Persistance:** Data is stored immediately in local storage so that you don't lose your data after refreshing.
- **Real-Time Data Handling:** Data is updated in real time, you see the change while you are changing.
- **Drag and Drop Animation:** Smooth animation for a better user experience while re-ordering and modifying the links.

## Ranking

I secured the 4th position out of almost 30 participants.
